# xdays-reinforcementLearning

One of my x days challenges. Now I try to learn (basic) Reinforcement Learning within x days, The repository consist of some implementation of RL algorithm or solution to some problem provided by OpenAI Gym.

So, what is the value of x? Let's solve it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why x? not 23 hours? 7 days? 1 month?

As Peter Norvig said(http://norvig.com/21-days.html):

"...it doesn't seem reasonable to assume that all skills (e.g., programming, chess playing, checkers playing, and music playing) could all require exactly the same amount of time to master, nor that all people will take exactly the same amount of time." 

My focus is on mastery. I know that time is limited, but lets eliminate the variable here.

The question should be "How do I learn something well?" What should be the sequence of learning? Can I learn something on my own? Would I require someone to teach me? Who would that person be?

Well, I think that applies to everything that is not trivial. Like this one.
